## Commit Message Examples
In this command, a commit having a judge status will be automatically created after submitting a solution to a online judge:

* `Cxdeforces 999A: Accepted`
* `Cxdeforces 999B: Wrong Answer`
* Also you can customize commit message

## Installation

Installation process takes a step, type a following command:

    $ gem install git-contest

### Requirements
Need to install:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
    * `ruby --version` >= 1.9.2
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
    * `git --version` >= 1.7

## Command Usage
There are 4 basic sub-commands:

### init
Initialize a git repository.

    $ git contest init

### start
Start a contest branch.

    $ git contest start <contest-branch> [based-branch]

After this command, `<contest-branch>` is created based on `<based-branch>`.

Example:

    $ git contest start cxdeforces_round_123
    ->  the branch `cxdeforces_round_123` is created

### finish
Finish a contest branch.

    $ git contest finish <contest-branch>

After this command, `<contest-branch>` is merged into `<based-branch>`, and then removed.

Example:

    $ git contest finish cxdeforces_round_123
    ->  the branch `cxdeforces_round_123` is merged and closed

### submit
Submit a solution to the online judge.

    $ git contest submit <site>

Example:

    $ git contest submit cxdeforces -c 123 -p A
    -> submit a solution to cxdeforces 123A

#### Basic Options

##### Problem ID: `-p`, `--problem-id`

Type: `String`

Set problem-id, this option is used almost all sites.

    $ git contest submit site -p 10000

##### Contest ID: `-c`, `--contest-id`

Type: `String`

Set contest-id, this option is used codeforces.

    $ git contest submit site -c 123

##### Source File: `-s`, `--source`

Type: `String`, Default: `main.*`

Set submitting code's filename.

    $ git contest submit site -s source.cpp

##### Programming Lanaguage: `-l`, `--language`

Type: `String`

    $ git contest submit site -s source.cxx -l C++

When do not set this option, **git-contest** will resolve language from source filename. (`aaa.cpp` -> `C++`)
